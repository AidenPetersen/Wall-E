# Wall-E
A Discord bot written in JavaScript, on the Node.js environment, using the Discord.js library. This is a personal project started as a way to create a Discord Bot to fulfill needs that were not able to be fulfilled by other bots and became my project during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this, I was challenged to learn JavaScript and create a program that evolved to be used by the 700+ members of the Iowa State College of Engineering Discord. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out on Discord by my username, `rohangupta#8570`. I hope this bot/project helps you in some way.
